I followed the starter code to complete the assignment.

Ob#1:

Max temp is the highest when the city latitude is between -20 to 20. And temp start to drop when latitube is higher, away from equator.

Cities in lower latitude between -20 to 20 tend to have less humidity.

Cloudiness doesn't seem to be related to city latitude.
